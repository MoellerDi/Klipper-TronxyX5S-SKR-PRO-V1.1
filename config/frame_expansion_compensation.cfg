[z_thermal_adjust]
temp_coeff: 0.0057 #0.0067 #0.0077
#   The temperature coefficient of expansion, in mm/degC. For example, a
#   temp_coeff of 0.01 mm/degC will move the Z axis downwards by 0.01 mm for
#   every degree Celsius that the temperature sensor increases. Defaults to
#   0.0 mm/degC, which applies no adjustment.
smooth_time: 2.0
#   Smoothing window applied to the temperature sensor, in seconds. Can reduce
#   motor noise from excessive small corrections in response to sensor noise.
#   The default is 2.0 seconds.
#z_adjust_off_above:
#   Disables adjustments above this Z height [mm]. The last computed correction
#   will remain applied until the toolhead moves below the specified Z height
#   again. The default is 99999999.0 mm (always on).
#max_z_adjustment:
#   Maximum absolute adjustment that can be applied to the Z axis [mm]. The
#   default is 99999999.0 mm (unlimited).
sensor_type: ATC Semitec 104GT-2
#   Type of sensor - common thermistors are "EPCOS 100K B57560G104F",
#   "ATC Semitec 104GT-2", "ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G", "Generic 3950",
#   "Honeywell 100K 135-104LAG-J01", "NTC 100K MGB18-104F39050L32",
#   "SliceEngineering 450", and "TDK NTCG104LH104JT1". See the
#   "Temperature sensors" section for other sensors.
sensor_pin: T2
#   Analog input pin connected to the sensor.
min_temp: 10
max_temp: 65
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error.
#   These parameters must be provided.
